All parameters are from Alexnet.
Assuamption:
Wt, Ht will be set to each PE manually.// just for first Layer
boundary of k',c,a(dense flow is needed),w will be calculated in Testbench as input for convolutional layers (do not know FC).
For boundary of a in sparse data flow, will need number of data in compressed unit.
Wt and Ht are 4x to make the dataflow more easy.
//----------------------------------------------PPU--------------------------------------------------------//
conv_layer:
Flow: Accumulator buffer drain data to RELU module, maxpool
PPU_to_CNTL_in.data_flow_PPU is 0 or 1 maybe. depend on the sprsity of input.
After compressing the input or weight, make sure the totoal number of them is 4x(Fx or Ix) to make the dataflow more easy. padding zeros if it is necessary.

//-----------------------------------------------Dram------------------------------------------------------//
Simple model for Dram, 50 GB/s for SCNN in paper. 
have not decided if add FIFO between Dram and PE. Because clock_frequency of Dram is different with PE. 
Otherwiseï¼š
Assume clock_frequency is 1 GHZ (changeable). # of data=50*8/1/16=25 will be fetched in one clock cycle .
