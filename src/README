All parameters are from Alexnet.
Assuamption:

Boundary of k' will be calculated in Testbench as input for convolutional layers (do not know FC). K/Kc-1
//-----------------------------------------------Dram------------------------------------------------------//
Simple model for Dram, 50 GB/s for SCNN in paper. 
have not decided if add FIFO between Dram and PE. Because clock_frequency of Dram is different with PE. 
Otherwiseï¼š
Assume clock_frequency is 1 GHZ (changeable). # of data=50*8/1/16=25 will be fetched in one clock cycle .
