All parameters are from Alexnet.
Assuamption:
Wt, Ht will be set to each PE manually.// just for first Layer
boundary of k',c,a(dense flow is needed),w will be calculated in Testbench as input for convolutional layers (do not know FC).
For boundary of a in sparse data flow, will need number of data in compressed unit.
//-----------------------------------------------Dram------------------------------------------------------//
Simple model for Dram, 50 GB/s for SCNN in paper. 
have not decided if add FIFO between Dram and PE. Because clock_frequency of Dram is different with PE. 
Otherwiseï¼š
Assume clock_frequency is 1 GHZ (changeable). # of data=50*8/1/16=25 will be fetched in one clock cycle .
